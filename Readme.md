DNS-over-HTTPS Client
==============

Client software to query DNS over HTTPS, using [Google DNS-over-HTTPS protocol](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https)
and [IETF DNS-over-HTTPS (RFC 8484)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8484.txt).

Note: This is a fork from origional project to meet my personal need, i.e. to provide a DoH client without UDP DNS, and it's still under construction.(You may use original project for general purpose)
